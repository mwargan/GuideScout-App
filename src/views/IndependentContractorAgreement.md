This Agreement is made between GuideScout (operated by M Media EI France) and you, as a guide on the platform, henceforth known as "Guide".

Companies offering tours and services on the platform are referred to as "Clients".

This Agreement outlines the terms and conditions under which the Guide operates on the GuideScout platform.

1. Role

The Guide is an independent contractor, not an employee. The Guide acknowledges that they are not an employee of GuideScout nor any Client, and that they are responsible for their own taxes, insurance, and compliance with local laws. The Guide understands that this Agreement does not create an employer-employee relationship.

The Guide is free to set their own schedule and pricing by accepting or not the offers made by Clients. The Guide is under no obligation to accept any offers.

The Guide is free to work with other companies or clients, and GuideScout does not control the Guide's work schedule or methods. The Guide acknowledges that they are not entitled to any benefits provided by GuideScout or Clients, such as health insurance, retirement plans, or paid time off.

Any offer made by a Client is not binding until the Guide accepts it. The Guide is free to accept or reject any offer.

If The Guide accepts an offer, they are responsible for providing the services as agreed with the Client.

A Guide may also be a guest operator using the platform for one-time tour offers under specific terms.

1. Services

The Guide will provide guided tours as agreed with Clients to the best of their ability.

The Guide is solely responsible for compliance with local laws, licensing, and taxes.

For guest operators, tours must be clearly marked and may be limited in frequency or scope.

3. Insurance and Liability

The Guide agrees to carry professional liability insurance where required.

The Guide holds GuideScout harmless from any liability or claim arising from services provided.

4. Payment

GuideScout will facilitate payments via a third-party payment processor (Stripe). The Guide will receive payment from GuideScout, not the Client, for services rendered.

Platform fees (if any) will be disclosed prior to listing services. Platform fees apply to companies, not individual guides.

The Guide will receive payment after the tour is completed, minus any applicable fees. The payment may be made up to 14 days after the tour.

The Guide is responsible for any taxes or fees incurred from payments received.

5. Termination

Either party may terminate this agreement with 14 days' notice except when the Guide has accepted a Client's offer, in which case this Agreement and the specific engagement become irrevocable and binding until the services are rendered or the Client cancels as per their rights.

6. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of France as well as the laws of the European Union.
