Once you agree to these terms, you enter into an agreement with GuideScout and M Media (the “Agreement”). By clicking “Accept tour offer” you expressly acknowledge that you have read, understood, and taken steps to thoughtfully consider the consequences of this Agreement, and that you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement with GuideScout and M Media.

This Agreement is made between GuideScout (operated by M Media EI France) and you, as a guide on the platform, henceforth known as "Guide" or "you".

Companies offering tours and services on the platform are referred to as "Clients".

Guests are individuals who book tours or services through the Clients.

This Agreement outlines the terms and conditions under which you operate on the platform.

You acknowledge that you make the choice to enter into this Agreement willingly and free of coercion.

1. Role

You are an independent contractor, not an employee. You acknowledge that you are not an employee of GuideScout nor any Client, and that you are responsible for your own taxes, insurance, and compliance with local laws. You understand that this Agreement does not create an employer-employee relationship.

You are free to set your own schedule and pricing by accepting or not the offers made by Clients. You are under no obligation to accept any offers.

You are free to work with other companies or clients, and GuideScout does not control you's work schedule or methods. You acknowledge that you are not entitled to any benefits provided by GuideScout or Clients, such as health insurance, retirement plans, or paid time off.

Any offer made by a Client is not binding until you accept it. You are free to accept or reject any offer.

If you accept an offer, you are responsible for providing the services as agreed with the Client.

2. Licence

During the term of this Agreement, GuideScout and M Media grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-assignable licence to install and use the App for no fee, for the purposes of receiving and responding to Offers and accessing services associated with your Services.

3. Services

You can go online in the App if, when, where, and for however long, you choose.

You may be sent Offers for the different tour options that you qualify for. If you are sent an Offer you will be provided with information about the Offer to allow you to decide whether to accept and provide the Services.

You can accept or reject Offers at your discretion.

You will provide guided tours as agreed with Clients to the best of your ability.

You are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, licensing, and taxes.

For guest operators, tours must be clearly marked and may be limited in frequency or scope.

It is your responsibility (and not GuideScouts or M Medias) to:
- determine an effective, efficient, and safe manner to provide Services
- provide all necessary equipment, tools, and other materials necessary to provide Delivery Services, at your own cost, unless otherwise outlined by the Client in the Offer
- obtain, operate, and maintain your tools, equipment, and any other materials necessary to provide Services
- pick up Guests from relevant locations to fulfil Offers
- communicate with Clients and Guests as appropriate regarding logistics or instructions about your Services

You acknowledge that:
- GuideScout is not responsible or liable for acts or omissions of any Client or Guest in relation to you, or your Services
- you are responsible for taking reasonable precautions to protect yourself and third parties in relation to the acts or omissions of a Client, a Guest, or other third parties
- you are responsible for liabilities to Clients, Guests, or other third parties that directly arise from your acts or omissions
- you carry out your own trade and business when providing Services
- all information provided by you to GuideScout is accurate, truthful, and up to date

While there are generally no consequences for rejecting or cancelling Offers, you will not receive a payment for Offers that you reject or cancel. Your status tier in rewards programs, or access to rewards-program benefits, may be impacted by your rates of accepting or cancelling Offers. Repeat cancellations may also trigger fraud-monitoring processes.

1. Insurance and Liability

You agree to carry professional liability insurance where required.

You hold GuideScout harmless from any liability or claim arising from services provided.

5. Licence and permission to work

You must at all times have legal authorization to provide Services or accept Offers using the platform. This includes requirements that:
- you are of the legal age to provide Services
- you hold all valid licences, insurance, permits, approvals, and authority necessary for you to provide Services
- you are not disqualified from providing Services under any applicable laws or regulations

6. Payment

You will be paid a fee for each successfully completed Offer.

You will be paid the amount agreed upon in the Offer you accepted. No additional fees or commissions will be charged by GuideScout.

You are expected to provide the Client your Services within the time frame agreed upon in the Offer. No overtime or additional fees will be paid to you unless explicitly agreed upon in the Offer.

GuideScout will facilitate payments via a third-party payment processor (Stripe). You will receive payment from GuideScout, not the Client, for services rendered.

Platform fees (if any) will be disclosed prior to listing services. Platform fees apply to companies, not individual guides.

You will receive payment after the tour is completed, minus any applicable fees. The payment may be made up to 14 days after the tour.

You are responsible for any taxes or fees incurred from payments received.

7. Termination

Either party may terminate this agreement with 14 days' notice except when you has accepted a Client's offer, in which case this Agreement and the specific engagement become irrevocable and binding until the services are rendered or the Client cancels as per their rights.

8. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of France as well as the laws of the European Union.
