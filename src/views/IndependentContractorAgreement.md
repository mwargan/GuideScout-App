# Independent Contractor Agreement

This Agreement is made between GuideScout (operated by M Media EI France) and you, as a guide on the platform, henceforth known as "Guide".

The Guide is free to set their own schedule and pricing.

A Guide may also be a guest operator using the platform for one-time tour offers under specific terms.

The Guide is solely responsible for compliance with local laws, licensing, and taxes.

For guest operators, tours must be clearly marked and may be limited in frequency or scope.

The Guide holds GuideScout harmless from any liability or claim arising from services provided.

4. Payment

GuideScout will facilitate payments via a third-party payment processor (Stripe).

Platform fees (if any) will be disclosed prior to listing services. Platform fees apply to companies, not individual guides.

The Guide will receive payment after the tour is completed, minus any applicable fees.

The Guide is responsible for any taxes or fees incurred from payments received.

5. Termination

Either party may terminate this agreement with 14 days' notice.

6. Governing Law
